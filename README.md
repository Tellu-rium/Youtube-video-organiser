## 🔧 How to Run

## 📸 Demo
- A functional **YouTube look-alike homepage** (static).  
- Thumbnails and channel pictures are fetched from online sources (`img.youtube.com` and Google CDN).  

---

## 📌 Notes
- This is **not functional YouTube** (no video playback or dynamic API).  
- It’s meant for **practice and learning HTML/CSS**.  
- All images and icons are either:
  - Taken from open assets (YouTube CDN)  
  - Or stored locally in the `/icon`, `/sidebar-icons`, `/channel-pictures`, `/thumbnail` folders

## 🏆 Future Improvements
- Add **JavaScript** to make the search bar interactive.  
- Add **dark mode toggle**.  
- Add **responsive layout** for mobile/tablet view.  
- Fetch **live video data** using the YouTube Data API.
